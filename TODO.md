# TODO

* collision detection
* spring damper for ground forces
* proper lift/drag ratio for high Reynolds numbers
* 3d cockpit with good projections
* mfd for reentry and orbital mechanics
* detailed onboard systems (e.g. airlock, life support, auxiliary power units)
* threads for rendering, simulation, and loading of data
* event-based radio
* missions and high scores
* inspiration from other games (e.g. Orbiter)
* good tessellation for planet spheres
* atmospheric rendering, clouds, water, elevation maps, fractal micro textures and maps
