# TODO

* tests using glReadPixels or frame buffer
* replace glGenTexture with glBindBuffer? (page 335)
* HDR bloom
* multisampling
* create and load Blender model
* shadows, windows, reflections, greyscale cameras, MFDs
* frame buffer objects for non-blocking data transfer
* skybox for nebulas
* point sprites for stars, atmospheric flicker using sprite arrays
* point light sources
* cloud erosion
* texture loading
* project on sphere
* view matrix, model matrix stack, light position
* good tessellation for planet spheres
* collision detection
* multiple rigid or flexible objects
* create windows using blending
* test shaders (colors, normals, displacement, elevation map)
* free floating object
* thrusters
* model with multiple moving parts (e.g. gear)
* spring damper for ground forces
* proper lift/drag ratio for high Reynolds numbers
* 3d cockpit with good projections
* draw points, lines, triangle strips, mfd for reentry and orbital mechanics
* detailed onboard systems (e.g. airlock, life support, auxiliary power units)
* threads for rendering, simulation, and loading of data
* event-based radio
* missions and high scores
* inspiration from Orbiter 2016, Rigs of Rods
* atmospheric rendering, clouds, water, elevation maps, fractal micro textures and maps
