# TODO

* separate files for tests, functions, and main program
* update CuTest: https://github.com/aiobofh/cutest
* dynamic lists
* bind more than one texture
* create and load Blender model
* objects with kinematic chain
* shadows (mask color pipeline output)
* blinking beacon lights
* HDR bloom (separable convolution)
* replace glGenTexture with glBindBuffer? (page 335)
* multisampling
* windows (blending, reflections), greyscale cameras, MFDs
* frame buffer objects for non-blocking data transfer
* skybox for nebulas
* point sprites for stars, atmospheric flicker using sprite arrays
* point light sources
* cloud erosion
* texture loading
* project on sphere
* view matrix, model matrix stack, light position
* good tessellation for planet spheres
* collision detection
* multiple rigid or flexible objects
* create windows using blending
* test shaders (colors, normals, displacement, elevation map)
* free floating object
* thrusters
* model with multiple moving parts (e.g. gear)
* spring damper for ground forces
* proper lift/drag ratio for high Reynolds numbers
* 3d cockpit with good projections
* draw points, lines, triangle strips, mfd for reentry and orbital mechanics
* detailed onboard systems (e.g. airlock, life support, auxiliary power units)
* threads for rendering, simulation, and loading of data
* event-based radio
* missions and high scores
* inspiration from Orbiter 2016, Rigs of Rods
* atmospheric rendering, clouds, water, elevation maps, fractal micro textures and maps
