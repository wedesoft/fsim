# TODO

* set material constants in shader
* only keep reference to material constants (not the texture image)
* surface -> (named) group, top-level default group
* use relative path when loading material and texture files
* make object name optional
* more parse error information, reset lexer and parser
* render to VAOs with one program (setup of vertex array pointers)
* read Wavefront data from file
* surface smoothing groups
* look at NASA 3D models
* create and load Blender model
* rename project and library
* bind more than one texture
* objects with kinematic chain
* shadows (mask color pipeline output)
* blinking beacon lights
* EF2000 like cockpit controls (quick access views)
* EF2000 like gear suspension
* HDR bloom (separable convolution)
* multisampling
* windows (blending, reflections), greyscale cameras, MFDs
* frame buffer objects for non-blocking data transfer
* skybox for nebulas
* point sprites for stars, atmospheric flicker using sprite arrays
* point light sources
* cloud erosion
* project on sphere
* view matrix, model matrix stack, light position
* good tessellation for planet spheres
* collision detection
* multiple rigid or flexible objects
* create windows using blending
* test shaders (colors, normals, displacement, elevation map)
* free floating object
* thrusters
* model with multiple moving parts (e.g. gear)
* spring damper for ground forces
* proper lift/drag ratio for high Reynolds numbers
* 3d cockpit with good projections
* draw points, lines, triangle strips, mfd for reentry and orbital mechanics
* detailed onboard systems (e.g. airlock, life support, auxiliary power units)
* threads for rendering, simulation, and loading of data
* event-based radio
* missions and high scores
* inspiration from Orbiter 2016, Rigs of Rods
* atmospheric rendering, clouds, water, elevation maps, fractal micro textures and maps
